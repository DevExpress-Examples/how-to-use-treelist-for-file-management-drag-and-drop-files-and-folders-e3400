# How to use TreeList for file management (drag and drop files and folders)


<p>This example is based on the Explorer module contained within the TreeListMainDemo sample project. It illustrates how to implement the Drag and Drop functionality in TreeList, which will also allow the moving of actual folders and files. To implement such Drag and Drop functionality, handle <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraTreeListTreeList_CalcNodeDragImageIndextopic">CalcNodeDragImageIndex </a> to customize an image to be dragged and the <strong>DragDrop</strong> event to implement custom drag logic, as well as the logic of moving files and folders.</p>
